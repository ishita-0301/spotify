"""AI-based automatic playlist recommender.

Builds a lightweight *taste profile* from the signed-in user's own history — the
moods they've requested and the audio attributes (tempo / valence / energy) and
artists of the tracks in playlists they've already generated — then uses the
same Gemini + Spotify providers as the main engine to synthesize fresh playlist
suggestions.

Each suggestion carries a title, a short human explanation of *why* it was
recommended, a preview of selected tracks, and its target attributes. Nothing is
ever written to Spotify here; a recommendation only becomes a saved playlist
when the user explicitly accepts it (see `Database.accept_recommendation`).

A suggestion the user has rejected (tracked by its stable `signature`) is never
regenerated, so refreshing keeps surfacing genuinely new ideas.
